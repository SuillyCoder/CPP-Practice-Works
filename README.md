# CPP-Practice-Works
This is a series of files meant to study and gain proficiency in C++

Yep, you're reading that right. Learned C++ a couple of days ago, and have been practicing ever since. 
I have also delved into the concepts of Object Oriented Programming.

I know it's widely used in Java, but I thought I would be able to get the concepts of it early on so that 
I could get a step ahead in terms of the programming fundamentals. 

Nevertheless, these exercises and files could also help you in case you'd also want to 
try out C++ yourself. If you've tried out C before, then C++ will be WAY WAY easier

(Ehem, I'm looking at you, string handling)

Well, happy coding! :D :D :D
